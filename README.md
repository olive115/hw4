Q1 : 10 lines are drawn for every for loop.
Q2 : The first apperance of the number 10 determines the angle at which the lines will be drawn in on the inside (10 beng close to the canvas 100 being more towards the middle). The second 10 determines the width the lines will be drawn in on the outside/how close the lines will be touching the right side of the canvas from the left. The third 10 determines how the lines are going to be distributed, the higher the number the more the lines are spread apart.
